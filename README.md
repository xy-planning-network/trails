# Go on the Trails

## What's Trails
Trails is our attempt at unifying the code we've written to power a small handful of web applications. We prefer the slower method of walking the trails and staying closer to the dirt than something speedier on the road. This bad boy is just getting of the ground and will be in v0 for the foreseeable future.
